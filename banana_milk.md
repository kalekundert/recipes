Notes:
This looks good, but I haven't made it yet.  The appeal is that it's an quick and easy desert recipe that uses very common ingredients.  Some people have recommended adding ice or using more spices.

Reagents:
1 banana
1 cup milk
1.5 tsp sugar
0.5 tsp vanilla
a dash of cinnamon

Procedure:
Mix all the ingredients except for cinnamon in a blender and process until smooth.  Garnish with cinnamon and serve immediately.
