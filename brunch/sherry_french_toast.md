I'm curious what french toast with sherry would taste like.

Ingredients
===========
4 eggs
½ cup of milk
¼ cup of cream sherry
3 tbsp brown sugar
1 tsp ground nutmeg
1 tsp vanilla extract
12 slices day old French or Italian bread
1 tbsp ground cinnamon

Recipe
======
1. In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs, add the milk, ½ of the cinnamon, 
   cream sherry, brown sugar, nutmeg and vanilla; stir well to combine.

2. Soak bread slices in egg mixture, flipping to coat each side until 
   saturated.

3. Heat a lightly buttered griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Brown 
   slices on both sides, sprinkle with cinnamon and serve hot.

4. Garnish with powdered sugar, cinnamon and/or maple syrup!
