Waffle Recipe
=============

Ingredients
-----------
- 270g all-purpose flour
- 6g baking powder (2 tsp?)
- 6g salt (Â½ tsp)

- 1/2 stick unsalted butter
- 3 large eggs
- 454g milk  (420g water, 34g powder)
- 42g sugar

- 170g chocolate chips

Instructions
------------
Begin by preheating the waffle iron.  Mix the dry ingredients together in one
bowl and wet ones in another.  Sugar counts as a wet ingredient because it is
so water-soluble.  Combine the wet and dry mixtures, along with any extra 
ingredients such as chocolate chips or blueberries.  Mix as little as possible;
the goal is to get most of the flour wet, not to get rid of the lumps.

Ladle some of the batter onto the waffle iron and you're good to go!  Six 
waffles is usually the right amount for me.

Dehydrated Milk
===============
The recipe calls for 2 cups of milk, which corresponds to 420g water and 34g 
dehydrated milk powder.  As a sanity check, 34g of powder should correspond to 
about a half cup.
