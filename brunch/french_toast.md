Reagents:

4 eggs
2/3 cups milk
1 tbsp sugar
2 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp salt

4 slices of Pugliese (slightly stale)

Butter
Maple syrup
Powdered sugar


Procedure:

Before anything else, get out the butter and start heating up the frying
pan (medium-low heat).  The whisk together eggs, milk, and spices.  Dunk a
few slices of bread in the egg mixture (both sides) and put some butter in
the frying pan.  It won't take long for the butter to burn, so quickly move
the bread into the pan and turn the heat up to medium.

Once the toast is cooking, don't move it.  No matter what!  The first side
will cook a bit faster, but both sides will be done in about a minute.
