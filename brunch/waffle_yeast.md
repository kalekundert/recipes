Ingredients
===========
- 241 g all-purpose flour
- 340 mL (1½ cups) milk
- 6 tbsp (85 g) butter, melted
- 39-57 g (2-3 tbsp) maple syrup, optional
- 2 large eggs
- ¾ tsp salt
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1½ tsp instant yeast

If using active dry yeast:
- 59 g (¼ cup) milk at 100-110°F
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 packet (2¼ tsp) active dry yeast
- Let stand for 10 min; foam should reach ½ cup mark.
- Use 281 g milk instead of 340 for batter.

Recipe
======
1. Combine all the ingredients in a large bowl.  Mix until well-incorporated, 
   but don't knead.

2. Let rise for 1h at room temperature.  (This step may be optional.)

3. Cover and let rest overnight in the refrigerator.

4. Ladle ≈¼ cup of batter into each waffle mold and cook until the light goes 
   off.

Notes
=====
- Active dry yeast is probably better for the overnight version of this recipe
