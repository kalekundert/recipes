Ingredients
===========
2 cups lukewarm water (about 100°F)
1 tsp. active dry yeast
1 cup milk
27 oz. (6 cups) unbleached all-purpose flour; more or less as needed
1 Tbs. plus 1 tsp. coarse salt
Vegetable oil for the bowl
3 to 4 Tbs. unsalted butter, melted
Cornmeal or flour for dusting the peel
1 tsp. nigella (black onion) seeds or 1 Tbs. sesame seeds for sprinkling (optional)

Half Batch (Metric)
===================
1/4 cup warm water
1 gram active dry yeast

1/2 cup warm milk
3/4 cup warm water
360 grams flour
10 grams salt

Vegetable oil
Unsalted butter
Cornmeal or flour
Nigella (black onion) or sesame seeds (optional)

To Make The Dough
=================
Put 1/2 cup of the water in a cup or glass and stir in the yeast. Heat the milk
in a small saucepan to lukewarm, about 100°F. Pour the milk and the remaining
1-1/2 cups water into a large bowl. Stir in the yeast mixture. Stir in about 2
cups of flour, stirring always in the same direction, until smooth. Stir in the
salt and continue stirring in flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough is too
stiff to stir but is still soft. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured
surface. Wash, dry, and lightly oil the bowl. Knead the dough until it's
smooth, 4 to 5 minutes, incorporating only enough flour (by keeping the work
surface dusted) to prevent the dough from sticking; the dough should be quite
soft and not tight.

Put the dough in the bowl, cover with plastic, and let it rise in a cool place
for 8 hours or overnight. If you're not ready to bake yet, punch down the
dough, put it in a plastic bag, and refrigerate it for up to 3 days.

To Shape and Bake
=================
About 1-1/4 hours before you want to serve the bread, set an oven rack to an
upper-middle rung. Put a large baking stone or unglazed quarry tiles on the
rack, leaving a 1-inch gap around the border. Heat the oven to 500°F.

Pull the dough away from the sides of the bowl and transfer it to a lightly
floured surface. Cut the dough in half, putting half of it back in the bowl
(covered) while you work with the other half.

Cut the dough half into five equal pieces. Shape each one into a ball by
rolling the dough on the counter or by using both hands to turn it, round it,
and smooth it. Put the balls to the side or back of the counter (flour the
surface), and brush each with melted butter. Cover with plastic and let rest
for 20 minutes. During the last few minutes of resting, prepare the remaining
dough the same way.

Dust a rimless baking sheet or peel lightly with cornmeal or flour. Put one
risen ball of dough on the floured work surface and push it out with your
fingertips to a 6- or 7-inch round; don't turn it over. Set it aside; repeat
with a second risen ball.

Return to the first piece, pushing it out to a rough 9x7-inch oval; you might
try stretching it by draping it over the back of your hands and pulling
gently. Repeat with the second piece of dough.

Place both ovals on the peel and pull on the front edges. Sprinkle on seeds,
if using. Transfer the flatbreads to the baking stone in the oven.  Homestyle
Indian Naan Recipe

Bake the breads until their rippled tops have light golden spots and the
bottoms are golden, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove them with a peel or long-handled
spatula, transfer to a rack to cool for about 5 minutes, and brush with more
melted butter, if you like. Wrap them in a cotton cloth to keep them soft and
warm. Repeat the shaping and baking process with the remaining 8 balls of
dough.
