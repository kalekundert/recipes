Reagents
========
1 large egg white
1/2 cup sugar
1 tsp nutmeg
1 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp salt
2 cups pecan halves

Procedure
=========
1. Preheat oven to 350F.
2. Prepare a baking sheet.

3. Whisk egg white until foamy.
4. Add sugar, slat, and spices.  Whisk until the mixture is thick and opaque.
5. Add pecans and mix until they are well-coated.
6. Individually transfer pecans to the baking sheet

7. Bake for 35 minutes, or until golden brown.
8. Let cool before eating.

Notes
=====
1. The bottom of the pecans got a little burnt.
2. This recipe makes more than enough batter for two cups of pecans.  I would
   try using closer to four cups next time.
