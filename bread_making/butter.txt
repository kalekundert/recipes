Sweet cream vs cultured butter
==============================
Cultured butter is typically created by adding live bacteria (cultures) to the 
butter before it's churned, versus regular butter which is cream that just goes 
straight to the churning machine.

The addition of the cultures causes the butter to taste slightly tangier, due 
to additional lactic acid.  It also results in a higher-fat product (why?), 
which in turns makes the butter more silky and gives it a richer taste.

Before the widespread industrialization of the dairy industry, most butter in 
the United States was made with cultured (also called clabbered) cream. Fresh 
cream from the evening milking would be allowed to sit out overnight so that 
the milk could settle and the cream could rise to the top.

During those unrefrigerated hours, the micro-organisms in the milk caused it to 
sour ever so slightly, taking on a nutty tanginess. This cream was then churned 
into butter, which retained those delightful flavors.

Once all dairy was routinely pasteurized the active cultures were killed, and 
therefore the milk could no longer sour on its own. Thus it became easier for 
farmers to make butter out of sweet cream, because creating cultured cream 
added another step (live cultures would have to be added back into the 
pasteurized milk, which is now standard practice in Europe).

This country grew used to the milder taste of sweet cream butter. That is, 
until it rediscovered cultured butter via the imported European stuff back in 
the 1990s. Because of its growing popularity, a handful of American dairy 
farmers started producing European-style high-fat cultured butter.
