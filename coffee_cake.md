Notes
=====
I haven't actually tried used this recipe before.  I also took the batter and 
streusel recipes from different websites, although the streusel one seems 
pretty standard.  I also converted the recipes to metric.

Dough Ingredients
=================
1/2 cup   butter
200 grams sugar
  2       eggs
  1 tsp   vanilla
120 grams flour
  4 grams baking powder  (1 tsp)
 11 grams baking soda    (1 tsp)
1/4 tsp   salt
307 grams sour cream

Streusel Ingredients
====================
90 grams brown sugar (1/2 cup)
80 grams chopped pecans (1/2 cup)
1/2 cup butter
28 grams flour (1/4 cup)
cinnamon to taste

Recipe
======
1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F.  Spray a 9x9 glass baking pan with PAM.
2. Mix the dry ingredients (flour, baking *, salt)
3. Beat the butter and sugar together.  Then slowly add the eggs, sour cream, 
   vanilla, and flour mixture (in that order).
4. Spread batter into the baking pan.
5. Make the streusel topping by cutting the four ingredients together with a 
   pastry thing.
6. Bake 30 minutes.

Notes
=====
This recipe makes too much batter for a 9x9 baking pan.  Either scale down the 
recipe (hard without using fractional eggs) or don't use all of it.  I also had 
to bake for 1 hour, although in part that was because there was too much dough.
