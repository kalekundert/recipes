Ingredients
===========
1 lb green beans, trimmed
1/4 cup water
2 tsp extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp freshly ground pepper
1/3 cup crumbled blue cheese
1/3 cup toasted chopped walnuts (see tip)

Preparation
===========
1. Bring green beans and water to a boil in a large skillet. Reduce heat to a 
   simmer, cover and cook until the beans are just tender, 3 minutes. Uncover 
   and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the water has evaporated, 
   3 to 4 minutes more.

2. Add oil, salt and pepper to the pan and cook, stirring, 1 minute more.  
   Transfer the beans to a large bowl and toss with blue cheese until well 
   coated.  Sprinkle each serving with walnuts.

Tips & Notes
============
To toast chopped or sliced nuts, stir constantly in a small dry skillet over 
medium-low heat until fragrant and lightly browned, 2 to 4 minutes.
