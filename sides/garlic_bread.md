Reagents:
1 loaf Italian bread (Pugliese)
1/2 cup softened unsalted butter
2 large cloves of garlic
1 tablespoon parsley
1/4 cup Parmesan cheese

Procedure:
Preheat the oven to 350F.  Mix together the butter, garlic, and parsley then cut the bread in half horizontally.  Spread the butter mixture over both halves of the bread and cook for 10 minutes.

Remove the bread from the oven.  Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over the top and broil for 2-3 minutes.  Serve immediately.

Notes:
Be careful when broiling it, because it can get burnt pretty easily.  Also, in Austin's kitchen, be sure the knob actually clicks into the broil position, otherwise it will just heat up to 550F.
