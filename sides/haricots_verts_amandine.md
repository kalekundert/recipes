Ingredients
===========
- Kosher salt
- 450 g green beans (trimmed)
- 3 tbsp unsalted butter
- 85 g almonds (thinly sliced)
- 2 cloves garlic (thinly sliced)
- 1 shallot (thinly sliced)
- Juice from 1 lemon (25 mL)
- Pepper to taste

Recipe
======
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and prepare an ice bath. Add 
   green beans to boiling water and cook until tender-crisp, about 3 minutes. 
   Transfer to ice bath using a wire mesh spider or tongs. Allow to chill 
   completely, then drain and dry thoroughly with kitchen towels or paper 
   towels.

2. In a medium skillet, heat butter and almonds over medium-low heat and cook, 
   stirring frequently, until almonds are deeply browned and nutty, about 5 
   minutes. Add garlic and shallot and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, 
   about 2 minutes longer. Add lemon juice, along with a tablespoon or two of 
   water. Increase heat to high and stir and shake pan rapidly to emulsify, 
   about 30 seconds. The sauce should have a glossy sheen and not appear watery 
   or greasy. If it's still watery, continue to simmer and shake. If it looks 
   greasy, add another tablespoon of water to re-emulsify. When sauce is ready, 
   remove from heat and season to taste with salt and pepper.

3. Add beans to pan with sauce and toss to coat and combine. Return to medium 
   heat and cook, tossing, until heated through, about 1 minute. Serve 
   immediately.
