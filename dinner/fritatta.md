Recipe
======
1. Heat the oven: Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 400°F.

2. Cook the rice: Heat 1-2 tbsp oil in a sauce pot over medium-high heat.  Add 
   the rice and the spices, then sauté until most of the rice is "puffy" and 
   the spices are fragrant (3-5 min).  Add the chicken broth and the tomato 
   sauce, then simmer for 20-25 min.

3. Sauté the ingredients: If the meat is raw, cook that first in a large 
   nonstick frying pan or cast iron skillet and then remove it from the pan to 
   add back in later. Cook the vegetables with a little oil over medium-high 
   heat, starting with the longer-cooking veggies like onions and potatoes and 
   ending with softer veggies like red peppers, until cooked through. Add back 
   any meat or tofu and cook just enough to warm through.

4. Season the ingredients: Since the ingredients will be mixed with eggs, you 
   want to over-season them a bit here. Add whatever seasonings you wish to use 
   along with 1 teaspoon of the salt. Let this cook for a minute, then give it 
   a taste. It should taste strong, but still good. Add more spices or salt if 
   needed.

5. Add the cheese: Spread the vegetables into an even layer. Sprinkle the 
   cheese on top and let it just start to melt.

6. Add the eggs: Whisk the eggs together and pour them over the vegetables and 
   cheese. Tilt the pan to make sure the eggs settle evenly over all the 
   vegetables. Cook for a minute or two until you see the eggs at the edges of 
   the pan beginning to set.

7. Bake the frittata: Put the pan in the oven and bake until the eggs are set, 
   8 to 10 minutes. To check, cut a small slit in the center of the frittata. 
   If raw eggs run into the cut, bake for another few minutes; if the eggs are 
   set, pull the frittata from the oven.

8. Cool and serve: Cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then slice into wedges and 
   serve. Leftovers will keep refrigerated for a week.
