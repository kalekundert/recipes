Soup ingredients
================
- 2-3 pounds pork shoulder roast (or butt)
- 4 cups unsalted chicken cooking stock (110 mg sodium/cup)
- 1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce
- 1/4 cup rice vinegar
- 2 tbsp fish sauce
- 2 tbsp Thai red curry paste
- 1 tbsp fresh ginger
- 1 tbsp sambal oelek (or to taste)
- The juice of 1 lime
- 1 tbsp Chinese five spice
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 1/4 cup brown sugar
- ramen noodles

Topping ingredients
===================
- 2 cups shitake mushrooms (chopped)
- 1 carrot (grated)
- 1 jalapeno (sliced)
- 1 bunch of green onions (chopped)
- 4 eggs (hard boiled, soft boiled, or fried)

Roasted squash ingredients
==========================
- 1 medium acorn squash, seeded and diced
- 2 tbsp coconut oil, melted
- 1 tbsp curry powder
- 1 tbsp white miso paste (or 2 tsp soy sauce)
- 1 tbsp brown sugar
- pepper, to taste

Pork marinade ingredients
=========================
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- 2 tbsp low sodium soy sauce
- 2 tbsp rice vinegar
- 1 tbsp brown sugar

Instructions
============
1. Mix together the chicken stock, soy sauce (1/4 cup), rice vinegar (1/4 cup), 
   fish sauce, curry paste, ginger, sambal oelek, lime juice, five-spice, black 
   pepper, and brown sugar (1/4 cup) in the bowl of a crockpot, then add the 
   pork.

2. Cook on low for 7-8 hours.

3. About 40 minutes before you are ready to eat, get ready to roast the squash 
   by preheating the oven to 400°F.

4. In a small bowl mix together the melted coconut oil, curry powder, miso 
   paste, brown sugar and a good pinch of pepper.  Spread the cubed squash on a 
   greased baking sheet and pour the curry mixture over the squash. Toss well.  

5. Bake for 30-40 minutes, tossing a couple of times during cooking. You want 
   the squash to be lightly browned and crisp.

6. Meanwhile, remove the pork from the crockpot and replace it with the 
   mushrooms.  Cover the crockpot and crank the heat up to high.  In a medium 
   bowl, lightly shred the pork.

7. Heat a large skillet over medium heat.  Add the sesame oil.  Once hot, add 
   enough pork to cover just the surface of your skillet.  Mix together the 
   pork marinade and drizzle the mixture over the pork.  Stir and allow the 
   pork to caramelize.  The process should take 5-10 minutes.  Once one batch 
   of pork is done remove it from the skillet and continue with the next batch.
   Make the marinade for each batch.

8. Cook the ramen noodles in boiling water for about 5 minutes, then drain.  
   Place each serving of noodles in its own bowl, ladle the broth over the 
   noodles, then top with caramelized pork, curry roasted acorn squash, fried 
   egg, and any vegetables you want.

Notes
=====
1. I made this recipe in Fitzy's slow cooker by doubling the amount of broth 
   and using a 4 lb pork shoulder (with bone).  After 7h, the pork was not 
   really cooked.  Most of it was still too tough to pull, and some of it still 
   looked raw.  I think the problem was that the surface area to volume ratio 
   of the pork shoulder changed when I doubled the recipe.  Next time I make 
   ramen in Fitzy's slow cooker, I'll cut the pork into smaller pieces to help 
   ensure it all gets cooked.

   And in general, I think ~10 h is better than ~8.
