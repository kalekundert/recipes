- 2 tbsp butter
- 1 tbsp flour
- 3/4 cup milk (whole or 2%)

- 3/2 cups water
- 2 tsp vegetable stock concentrate
- 1 tsp Old Bay seasoning
- 340 g (3/4 lb) yukon gold potatoes

- 13 oz corn (frozen or canned)
- 2 tbsp cream cheese
- 1/4 cup Monterey Jack cheese

- 2 tbsp sour cream for garnish
- baguette or similar to garnish

Substitutes
===========
Cubanelle pepper:
- 2 jalapeno peppers
- 1 green bell pepper

Vegetable stock:
- Chicken stock

Old Bay seasoning:
- Cajun seasoning
- Chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, celery salt

Directions
==========
1. Prepare ingredients:

   - Dice jalapeno into 1/4" pieces.  Don't remove seeds.
   - Thinly slice scallions; separate greens and whites.
   - Dice potato into 1/4" pieces.
   - Drain and rinse corn.

2. Melt 2 tbsp butter into medium-sized pot over medium-high heat. Add green 
   pepper, and scallion whites. Saute 2-3 min or until softened.

3. Make a roux: Add 1 Tbsp flour then cook, stirring, until lightly brown 
   (approx 1 min).

4. Slowly add milk to roux a splash at a time, until fully added. Be careful 
   not to scald milk.

5. Add 1.5 cups water, potatoes, veggie stock concentrate, and 1 tsp old-bay 
   seasoning. Bring to a boil, and cook, stirring occasionally for 15-20 min 
   until potatoes are very tender.

6. Once potatoes are tender, reduce heat to low and mash with potato masher 
   until smooth.

7. Stir in cream cheese, jack cheese, and corn. Chowder should be VERY thick at 
   this point. Ok to dilute a bit by adding small splashes of water. Season to 
   your taste with salt, pepper, and old-bay.

8. Divide chowder between bowls, garnish with scallion greens, sour cream, and 
   toasted baguette.

Notes
=====
- Makes enough for 2 hungry people.
- If you'd like to add a bit of protein to this, I can recommend UNFLAVORED 
  protein powder (add at the same time as the corn) or oven-roasted chickpeas 
  (as a garnish)
