Ingredients
===========
6 oz (170 g) macaroni
6 oz (180 mL) condensed milk
6 oz (170 g) grated cheese

Directions
==========
1. Place macaroni in a medium saucepan or skillet and add just enough cold 
   water to cover. Add a pinch of salt and bring to a boil over high heat, 
   stirring frequently. Continue to cook, stirring, until water has been almost 
   completely absorbed and macaroni is just shy of al dente, about 6 minutes.

2. Immediately add evaporated milk and bring to a boil. Add cheese. Reduce heat 
   to low and cook, stirring continuously, until cheese is melted and liquid 
   has reduced to a creamy sauce, about 2 minutes longer. Season to taste with 
   more salt and serve immediately.

Notes
=====
- Condensed milk comes in 150 mL cans, so I usually scale this recipe down a 
  bit to compensate.

- I like to buy little blocks of cheese from the bargain bin for this recipe.  
  It's pretty cheap, about the right amount with no leftovers (170 g is 0.375 
  lb), and usually pretty interesting flavor-wise.
