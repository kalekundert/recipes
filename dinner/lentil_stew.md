Ingredients
===========
1 tbsp olive oil
1 onion, finely chopped
1 celery stalk, chopped (substitute: 1 red/green pepper)
2 carrots, chopped
1 tsp dried thyme
1 tsp dried oregano
1/2 tsp paprika
1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
1 cup lentils, picked over carefully and rinsed
1 can tomatoes (diced tomatoes), including liquid
1 fist-sized potato, diced into quarter-sized pieces
4 cups (or 2 cans) water or vegetable stock
Salt and pepper to taste

Optional:
Croutons or thick bread for garnish 
Parmesan cheese for garnish
Sour cream for garnish

Directions
==========
1. In a large pot heat olive oil until it shimmers. Add onion and cook until it 
   is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add celery and carrots and cook until they 
   begin to soften, another 5 minutes.
2. Add herbs and lentils and stir until lentils are coated. Cook for a minute. 
   Add tomatoes, breaking them up if they are whole. Add water and stir. 
3. Heat to boiling, then reduce heat and simmer and cook until lentils have 
   softened and are cooked through, about 35 to 40 minutes.
4. Blend with an immersion blender, so that the soup is smoother, but still 
   contains chunks of vegetables. (I don't have this type of blender. I 
   add diced potato to the pot after adding the tomatoes. This helps thicken 
   the stew.)
5. Ladle into bowls and add garnish, if using. Serve immediately.
