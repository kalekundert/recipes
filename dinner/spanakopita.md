Directions
==========
0. The night before: thaw the phyllo dough in the fridge.

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F with the rack in the lower-middle position.

2. Brush a 9-inch glass pie plate (either deep-dish or standard 
   size will work with this recipe) generously with olive oil and set on a 
   parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet.

3. Prepare the filling:

  - In a large bowl, combine chopped greens, chopped herbs, 54 g (1/4 cup) 
    olive oil, salt, and black pepper. Massage together to gently wilt the 
    greens, then set aside.

  - In a small sauté pan over medium heat, add 1 tablespoon olive oil, 
    scallions, and garlic and cook until wilted, about 5 minutes.

  - Add the hot mixture to the greens and combine to further wilt the 
    vegetables.

  - Add the trahanas (or your substitute of choice) and egg and thoroughly 
    combine.

  - Fold in the crumbled feta and optional tomatoes/olives

4. Assemble the pie:

  - Unroll thawed phyllo and keep it covered with a moist kitchen towel while 
    working.

  - Working with 1 sheet at a time, lay phyllo so that it is centered in the 
    pie pan with the excess draping over the rim. 

  - Brush generously with about 1 tablespoon olive oil.

  - Repeat with 3 more sheets of phyllo, each sheet placed perpendicular to the 
    previous one, brushing with olive oil before adding the next.

  - Add greens mixture to phyllo-lined pie.

  - Fold excess phyllo over greens and drape remaining 2 sheets of phyllo over 
    the top.

  - Drizzle with more olive oil.

  - Slice into portions using a serrated knife.

5. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 45 minutes. Allow to cool 
   at least 15 minutes before serving.
