Ingredients
===========
- 300g (10½ oz) strong plain flour, plus extra for dusting
- 5g fast-action yeast
- 1 tsp salt
- 200ml (7 fl oz) warm water
- 25g (1 oz) unsalted butter, melted
- 250g (9 oz) cold unsalted butter, in a block
- 100g (3½ oz) caster sugar, plus extra for sprinkling

Directions
==========
- Put the flour into the bowl of a freestanding mixer fitted with a dough hook. 
  Add the yeast to one side of the bowl and the salt to the other. Add the 
  water and melted butter and mix on a slow speed for two minutes, then on a 
  medium speed for six minutes.

- Tip the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and shape into a ball. Put 
  into a lightly oiled bowl. Cover with cling film and leave to rise for one 
  hour.

- Sandwich the butter between two sheets of greaseproof paper and bash with a 
  rolling pin, then roll out to a 14cm (5½ in) square. Place in the fridge to 
  keep chilled.

- On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to a 20cm (8 in) square. 
  Place the butter in the centre of the dough diagonally, so that each side of 
  butter faces a corner of the dough. Fold the corners of the dough over the 
  butter to enclose like an envelope.

- Roll the dough into a 45x15cm (18x6 in) rectangle. Fold the bottom third of 
  dough up over the middle, then fold the top third of the dough over. You will 
  now have a sandwich of three layers of butter and three layers of dough. Wrap 
  in cling film and place in the fridge for 30 minutes. This completes one 
  turn.

- Repeat this process twice more, so you have completed a total of three turns, 
  chilling the dough for 30 minutes between turns.

- Roll the dough into a rectangle as before. Sprinkle the dough with the caster 
  sugar and fold into thirds again. Working quickly, roll the dough into a 
  large 40x30cm (16x12 in) rectangle. Sprinkle the dough with caster sugar and 
  cut the dough into 12 squares.

- Grease a 12-cup muffin tin well with oil. Gather the dough squares up by 
  their four corners and place in the muffin tins, pulling the four corners 
  towards the centre of the muffin tin, so that it gathers up like a four-leaf 
  clover. Sprinkle with caster sugar and leave to rise, covered with a clean 
  tea towel, for 30 minutes until slightly puffed up.

- Preheat oven to 220C/200C(fan)/425F/Gas 7. Bake the pastries for 30-40 
  minutes, or until golden-brown. Cover with foil halfway through if beginning 
  to brown too much. Remove from the oven and leave to cool for a couple of 
  minutes before turning out onto a wire rack. Be careful not to burn yourself 
  on the caramelized sugar, but don’t leave them to cool for too long, or the 
  caramelized sugar will harden and they will be stuck in the tin.

- Serve warm or cold.
