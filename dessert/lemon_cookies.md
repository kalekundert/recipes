Ingredients
===========
≈25 cookies:
- 240g all-purpose flour, sifted
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted and cooled
- 200g granulated sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 large egg yolk
- 2 Tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 3 tsp freshly grated lemon zest (approx 1 medium lemon)
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 tsp lemon extract
- approx 1 cup confectioner's sugar (for coating)

- Parchment paper
- Insulated cookie sheet
- Stand mixer (optional)

Directions
==========
- Mix flour, baking soda, and salt.

- Melt butter, then let it cool to 90-100ºF.

- Mix the wet ingredients:

  - Mix melted butter and sugar until homogeneous.
  - Add egg and egg yolk, then beat until smooth.
  - Add lemon juice, lemon zest, and extracts.  This makes the mixture "break" 
    a little bit, but beat until as smooth as possible.

- Combine wet and dry ingredients.

  - The dough is stiff enough that a stand mixer is helpful here.

- Rest in the fridge for 2-4 hours. 

- Preheat the oven to 325ºF

- Roll dough into balls (approx 20-25 g in weight) and roll in confectioner's 
  sugar to coat. 

- Place sugar-coated dough on a parchment-lined baking sheet, separated by ≈2" 
  (i.e. 2 squares on the parchment grid).

- Bake for 10-13 min, or until the edges are set and the dough in the center is 
  soft, but not jiggling. Keep the dough in the fridge between batches.

- Allow cookies to finish "setting" on the cookie sheet for approx 3-4 min 
  before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
