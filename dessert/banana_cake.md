Ingredients
===========
275 grams flour
1 tsp salt (6 grams)
2 tsp baking soda (11 grams)
190 grams vegetable shortening
400 grams sugar
2 or 3 normal bananas (mashed)  (3: 360g)
4 eggs
115 grams chopped walnuts

Instructions
============
1. Mix dry ingredients.
2. Mash bananas and mix with eggs and walnuts.
3. Beat sugar and shortening until fluffy.
4. Slowly add banana/egg mixture to beaten shortening.
5. Slowly add flour mixture to the rest of the batter.
6. Bake in a greased 9x5x3 baking pan at 350Â°F for 65-75 minutes.

Ideas
=====
1. The cake collapsed in the middle a little bit.  I think this might be 
   because there's too much baking soda in the recipe.  Next time I should 
   compare against a lot of other recipes and see what's normal.
2. Simultaneously test that my baking soda is good and that bananas are acidic 
   by mixing some mashed up bananas with some baking soda.  There should be 
   bubbles.

Notes
=====
Bananas: pH 4.5 - 5.2
