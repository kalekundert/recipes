Ingredients
===========
Banana Syrup:
- 340 g (3-4) overripe bananas
- 210 g (1 cup) sugar

Wet Ingredients:
- 113 g (1 stick) butter, melted
- 2 eggs
- 1 tsp almond extract

Dry Ingredients:
- 255 g (2 cups) flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt
- 175 g (1 cup) chocolate chips (optional)

Instructions
============
1. Prepare the banana syrup by mashing the bananas into the sugar.

   - A stand mixer works particularly well, if you have one.
   - Try to get rid of as many big chunks of banana as possible.

2. Mix the wet ingredients, then combine with the banana syrup.

3. Mix the dry ingredients, then combine with the wet ones.

   - Don't overmix; the batter should be lumpy.

4. Pour the batter into a loaf pan lined with parchment paper.

5. Bake at 350°F for 50-60 min.

   - Internal temperature should be >200°F from bottom to top.  (The recipe 
     says 210°F, but my experience is that it should be a bit lower.)
