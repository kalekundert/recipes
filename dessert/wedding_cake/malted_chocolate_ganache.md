Ingredients
===========
- 1 cup heavy cream
- ¾ cup malted milk powder
- 1 cup milk chocolate (chopped)
- 1½ cups dark chocolate (chopped)

Directions (Immersion Blender)
==============================
These are the instructions that came with the recipe.

1. In a small saucepan whisk together heavy cream and malted milk powder; bring 
   to a boil over medium-high heat.

2. Place both chocolates in a medium heatproof bowl. Pour boiling cream over 
   chocolate and let stand until melted, about 1 minute. Using an immersion 
   blender, blend until smooth. 

3. Let stand at least 6 hours and up to overnight before using.

Directions (By Hand)
====================
I don't have an immersion blender, so I found a different ganache recipe 
(non-malted) that had instructions for how to do it by hand.  The instructions 
are pretty different, so I'm not sure if it'll work or not.

1. Chop the chocolate.  Use a serrated knife, which helps break the chocolate 
   into really small pieces.

2. Heat the cream on the stove until nearly simmering.  Also start to melt the 
   chocolate in the microwave.  The chocolate doesn't need to be melted all the 
   way; a partial melt is enough to help get a smooth emulsion.

3. Stir the cream and chocolate together.  The emulsion should be smooth and 
   glossy.

4. Add "a little bit" of softened unsalted butter, and continue stirring until 
   incorporated.  This is supposed to make the ganache richer and shinier.  The 
   recipe doesn't say how much to add, but from the picture I'd say about 1 
   tbsp.

5. Use immediately.
