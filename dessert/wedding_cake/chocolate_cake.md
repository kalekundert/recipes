Ingredients
===========
- 200 g (1½ cups) all-purpose flour
- 200 g (1 cup) superfine sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 40 g (⅓ cup) best-quality unsweetened cocoa
- 1½ sticks (175 g) soft unsalted butter
- 2 large eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- ⅔ cup sour cream

Directions
==========
1. Take everything out of the fridge so that all the ingredients can come to 
   room temperature.

2. Preheat the oven to 350°F and line and butter two 20cm / 8 inch sandwich 
   tins with removable bases.

3. Mix the flour, sugar and leavening agents in a large bowl and beat in the 
   soft butter until you have a combined and creamy mixture. Now whisk together 
   the cocoa, sour cream, vanilla and eggs and beat this into your bowl of 
   mixture.

4. Divide this batter, using a rubber spatula to help you scrape and spread, 
   into the prepared tins and bake until a cake tester, or a thin skewer, comes 
   out clean, which should be about 35 minutes, but it is wise to start 
   checking at 25. Also, it might make sense to switch the two cakes around in 
   the oven halfway through cooking time.

5. Remove the cakes, in their tins, to a wire rack and let cool for 10 minutes 
   before turning out of their tins. Don't worry about any cracks as they will 
   easily be covered by the icing later.
