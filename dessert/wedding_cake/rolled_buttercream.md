Ingredients
===========
- 1 cup light corn syrup
- 1 cup shortening
- ½ tsp salt
- 1 tsp clear vanilla extract
- ½ cup cocoa powder
- 2 lb confectioners' sugar

Directions
==========
1. In a large bowl, stir together the shortening and corn syrup. Mix in the 
   salt and vanilla flavoring, then gradually mix in the confectioners' sugar 
   until it is a stiff dough. If you are using a stand mixer, use the dough 
   hook attachment. Otherwise, knead by hand. If the dough is sticky, knead in 
   more confectioners' sugar until it is smooth. Store in an airtight container 
   at room temperature or in the refrigerator.

2. To use, roll out on a clean surface that has been dusted with confectioners' 
   sugar until it is ⅛" thick or thinner if you can. Drape over frosted and 
   chilled cakes and smooth the sides down, or cut into strips to make bows and 
   other decorations.

Notes
=====
I'm a little worried about adding raw cocoa powder to frosting.  My 
understanding with cocoa powder is that it's smoother, creamier, and less 
bitter it it's been boiled for a few minutes, but I don't see a way to do that 
with this recipe.
