Ingredients
===========
Dough:
118 g     (½ cup)    whole milk
2¼  tsp              yeast
67  g     (⅓ cup)    sugar
531 g     (4¼ cups)  flour (all-purpose)
1½  tsp              salt
1   tsp              lemon zest (optional)
1   tsp              vanilla
4                    eggs (beaten)
10  tbsp  (140 g)    unsalted butter (room temperature)

Filling:
174 g     (¾ cup)    heavy cream
100 g     (½ cup)    sugar
    pinch            salt
170 g     (6 oz)     bittersweet chocolate (66-74%, chopped)
8   tbsp  (112 g)    unsalted butter (diced, room temperature)
2   tsp              vanilla

Streusel:
60  g     (½ cup)    flour
45  g     (3 tbsp)   sugar
11  g     (1½ tbsp)  cocoa powder
½   tsp              salt
4½  tbsp  (64 g)     unsalted butter (melted)
60  g     (⅓ cup)    mini semisweet chocolate chips

Syrup:
135 g     (⅔ cup)    sugar
158 g     (⅔ cup)    water

Directions
==========
1. Mix the dry dough ingredients.

2. Beat in the eggs and the vanilla (dough hook).

3. Beat in the butter in two batches.

4. Knead ~10 minutes.

5. Shape into a ball and let rise 1-2h.

6. Punch down, cover, and refrigerate overnight (or for at least 4h).

7. Prepare the filling:
  
  - Simmer cream, sugar, and salt until completely dissolved (~5 min).

  - Vigorously stir in chocolate and butter until smooth.
  
  - Cool to room temperature.

8. Prepare the streusel:

  - Mix the dry streusel ingredients.

  - Stir in melted butter until small, moist clumps are formed.

  - Add chocolate chips once cooled to room temperature.

9. Prepare syrup

  - Mix sugar and water.

  - Simmer until dissolved (1 min).

10. Remove dough from refrigerator and divide in half.  For each half:

  - Roll into a 9" by 17" rectangle.

  - Spread with half the filling.

  - Roll into a tight 17" log.

11. Freeze both logs for 10 min.

12. Cut each log in half, twist the halves together (as if you were 
    braiding them), then coil the twist into a 9" loaf pan.

13. Cover and let rise for 60-90 min.  Alternatively, let rise overnight in the 
    refrigerator and bring to room temperature (1h) before baking.

14. Sprinkle streusel over each loaf.

15. Bake at 350°F until the center is between 185-210°F (~50 min).

16. Pour half of the syrup over each loaf.

17. Cool before serving.

Notes
=====
- I tend to significantly under-bake this dish.  I've increased the time 
  estimate to try to account for this, but I think it's really essential to 
  check the temperature (with a working thermometer).  Remember that you can 
  tent the loaf if you're concerned about the top getting burnt.
