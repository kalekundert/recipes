Directions
==========
Day 1:

- Proof the yeast

  - Heat the milk to 110°F.

  - Mix the milk, yeast, and 1 tsp of sugar.

  - Let sit for 5-10 minutes.

- Prepare the dough:

  - Mix the dry ingredients: flour, sugar, salt, and nutmeg

  - Mix the wet ingredients: proofed yeast, eggs, lemon zest, vanilla

  - Beat the wet ingredients into the dry ones until the dough comes together 
    in a soft mass, ≈2 min [1].

  - Add half the butter.

  - Beat until the dough is smooth and elastic, ≈5 min.

  - Add the remaining butter.

  - Beat until the dough is smooth and stretchy, ≈5 min.

  - Coat a clean bowl with ≈1 tbsp butter.

  - Shape the dough into a ball, then place into the buttered bowl.  Roll the 
    dough around to cover it with butter.

  - Cover and let rise for 1-2h.  It won't double in size, but should get 
    noticeably bigger.

  - Punch down, cover, and refrigerate overnight (or for at least 4h).

Day 1 or Day 2:

- Prepare the filling:

  - Heat cream, sugar, and salt until completely dissolved (≈5 min).

  - Vigorously stir in chocolate, butter, and vanilla until smooth.

  - Cool to room temperature.

- Prepare the streusel:

  - Mix the dry streusel ingredients.

  - Stir in melted butter until large, moist clumps are formed.

  - Add chocolate chips once cooled to room temperature.

Day 2:

- Prepare syrup:

  - Mix sugar and water.

  - Simmer until dissolved (1 min).

- Remove dough from refrigerator and divide in half.  For each half:

  - Roll into a 9" by 17" rectangle.

  - Spread with half the filling.

  - Roll into a tight 17" log.

- Freeze both logs for 10 min.

- Cut each log in half lengthwise, twist the halves together (as if you were 
  braiding them), then coil the twist into a 9" loaf pan [2].

- Cover and let rise at room temperature until puffy, but not doubled (60-90 
  min).

  - Alternatively, let rise overnight in the refrigerator and bring to room 
    temperature 1h before baking.

- Sprinkle streusel over each loaf.

- Bake at 350°F until the center is between 185-210°F (≈55 min) [3].

- Immediately after baking:

  - Stab each loaf ≈20 times with a skewer or paring knife, all the way to the 
    bottom.

  - Pour half of the syrup over each loaf.

- Cool before serving.

Notes
=====
[1] If using a stand mixer, the dough hook works well for this.

[3] The NYT recipe calls for a 40-50 min bake, but in my experience this is not 
    quite long enough.  Remember that you can tent the loaf if you're concerned 
    about the top getting burnt.
