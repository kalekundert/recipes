Ingredients
===========
- 1/3 cup water
- 250 g (1¼ cup) sugar
- 6 tbsp (3/8 cups, 1/4 cup + 2 tbsp) corn starch
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 6 cups blueberries
- 2 tbsp butter (unsalted)
- 1 tsp lemon juice
- 10" pie shell

Toppings:
- Whipped cream

Directions
==========
- Par-bake pie shell at 425°C for 10-12 min, until golden brown.  Let cool.

  - Poke holes in the bottom with a fork, and weigh down with pie weights or 
    dried beans.

- Combine sugar, water, cornstarch, and salt in a medium saucepan over medium 
  heat.  Stir to dissolve.

- Add half of the berries (3 cups).  Continue cooking, with constant stirring, 
  until the mixture comes to a boil and thickens.  It should be quite thick, 
  and the transition is pretty sudden.  Remove from heat.

- Add butter and lemon juice.  Stir, then allow to cool.

- Before the filling sets completely, stir in the remaining berries and pour 
  into the prepared pie shell.  Refrigerate to cool.
