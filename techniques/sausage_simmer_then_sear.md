Directions
==========
- Boil sausage for 7 min.

- Sear over high heat, with oil, for ≈3 min on each side.

- Let rest for 5 min.

Notes
=====
- The goal is to get the internal temperature of the sausages to 150°F.

- I thought it'd be better to boil the sausages for a fixed amount of time in 
  already boiled water, since that should be more consistent.  I measured the 
  internal temperature at different times:

    - 5m30: 100°F
    - 9m00: 160°F, but tasted overcooked (after searing)

  I needed to leave the thermometer in longer, the temperature continued to 
  rise for several minutes after removing from water:

  2021/01/23:
    - 7m00: 150°F - pretty good

  Note that both recipes referenced below call to add the sausage to room 
  temperature water, then to bring the water to a boil.

- I tried broiling the sausage instead of searing it, to try to avoid 
  generating so much smoke and splattered oil.

  Boil Time     Broil Time    Internal Temp   Notes
  =========     ==========    =============   =====
  7:00          10:00         220°F           [1]
  5:00          10:00         210°F           [2]

  [1] I didn't preheat the broiler.  I think that would've sped things up.
  [2] I did preheat the broiler; it maybe sped things up slightly.

- Above, I measured internal temperature after boiling, but not after searing.  
  Note that sear time is cumulative, i.e. for both sides:

  Boil Time  Boil Temp   Sear time    Sear Temp
  =========  =========   =========    =========
  7:00       ???         ???          180°F
  6:00       ???         3 min        180°F
  5:00       ???         3 min        170°F

  - Tried boiling a frozen sausage for 10m (isntead of 7)

- 2024/12/21:

  - I developed this recipe with Trader Joe's sausages.  Today I used 
    7/8"-diameter lamb sausages (from Sauvnor's).  I reduced the boil time to 6 
    min and the saute time to 2 min per side, but the sausages still ended up 
    with an internal temperature of 200°F.  In the future, I think I would have 
    to reduce the boil time even more.
