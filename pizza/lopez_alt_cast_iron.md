Ingredients
===========
Dough:
- 200 g (1¼ cup) bread flour
- 1 tsp (5 g) kosher salt, plus more for sprinkling
- ¼ tsp (2 g) instant yeast
- 138 grams (69%, 1 cup + 1 tbsp + 1 tsp) water
- 4 grams (1 tsp) extra-virgin olive oil

Toppings:
- ¾ cups pizza sauce
- 6 oz full-fat, dry mozzarella cheese (grated)
- Toppings as desired
- Small handful torn fresh basil leaves (optional)
- 1 ounces grated parmesan or pecorino Romano cheese (optional)

Brief Recipe
============
- Make dough
- Rest at room temperature for 8-24 h.
- Bake at 550°F for 12-15 min.

Recipe
======
1. Combine flour, salt, yeast, water, and oil in a large bowl. Mix with hands 
   or a wooden spoon until no dry flour remains. The bowl should be at least 4 
   to 6 times to volume of the dough to account for rising.

2. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap, making sure that edges are well- 
   sealed, then let rest on the countertop for 8-24 hours.  The dough should 
   rise dramatically and fill the bowl.

3. Shape the dough into a ball on a well-floured work surface.

4. Pour 1 to 2 tbsp of oil in the bottom of a 10-inch cast iron skillet. Place 
   the dough in the pan and turn to coat evenly with oil. Using a flat palm, 
   press the dough around the pan, flattening it slightly and spreading oil 
   around the entire bottom and edges of the pan. Cover tightly with plastic 
   wrap and let the dough sit at room temperature for two hours.

5. An hour before baking, adjust an oven rack to the middle position and 
   preheat oven to 550°F.

5. After two hours, dough should be mostly filling in the pan up to the edges. 
   Use your fingertips to press it around until it fills in every corner, 
   popping any large bubbles that appear. Lift up one edge of the dough to let 
   any air bubbles underneath escape and repeat, moving around the dough until 
   there are no air bubbles left underneath and the dough is evenly spread 
   around the pan.

6. Top the dough with pizza sauce, spreading the sauce all the way to the 
   edge of the pan.  Spread evenly with mozzarella cheese and any other 
   toppings, again going all the way to the edge. 

7. Transfer pan to oven and bake until top is golden brown and bubbly and 
   bottom is golden brown and crisp when you lift it with a thin spatula, 12 to 
   15 minutes.  Immediately sprinkle with grated parmesan or pecorino Romano 
   cheese.  Using a thin spatula, loosen pizza and peek underneath.  If bottom 
   is not as crisp as desired, place pan over a burner and cook on medium heat, 
   moving the pan around to cook evenly until it is crisp, 1 to 3 minutes.  
   Remove the pizzas and transfer to to a cutting board. Cut each one into six 
   slices and serve immediately.
