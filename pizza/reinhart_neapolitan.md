Ingredients
===========
Instant yeast variant:
- 574 g (4⅔ cups) all-purpose flour
- 12 g (1¾ tsp) salt
- 1 tsp instant yeast
- 54 g (¼ cup) olive oil
- 397 g (1⅔ cups) water (ice cold) (69.2% hydration)

Sourdough variant:
- 527 g (4¼ cups) all-purpose flour
- 12 g (1¾ tsp) salt
- 95 g starter
- 54 g (¼ cup) olive oil
- 350 g (1½ cups) water

Recipe
======
1. Mix the flour, salt, and yeast/starter in a large bowl.

2. Add the water and oil and mix until well combined.

3. Knead using a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment at medium speed for 
   at least 5 minutes.  The dough will be smooth and sticky.

4. Divide the dough into six pieces.  Each piece should weight ≈174 g.

5. Keep each sixth in a plastic bag in the refrigerator overnight.

6. Take the dough out of the refrigerator 2 hours before you want to eat.  On a 
   floured surface, shape the dough into discs that are about 5" wide and ½" 
   thick, then cover with plastic wrap [1].

7. 1 hour before you want to eat, place a pizza stone in the lowest rack of the 
   oven and preheat the oven to 550°F (or as hot as possible).

8. Toss or stretch the dough until it's about 12" in diameter [2], then place 
   on a baking sheet dusted with cornmeal.

9. Add toppings sparingly [3].

10. Bake for 6-9 minutes.

Footnotes
=========
1. Shaping the dough into a somewhat round shape when it comes out of the 
   refrigerator and letting it rest that way for 15-30 minutes makes it much 
   easier to toss.

2. Don't use a rolling pin to shape the dough.  This squeezes the air out and 
   results in a dense crust.

3. Topping ideas:

   - Hot sopressata, sweet peppers, goat cheese, honey
   - Ginger, balsamic vinegar, goat cheese
   - Shaved sweet potato, ricotta, sautéd onions

4. Thoughts about cheese:

   - Low-moisture whole milk (LMWM) is ideal
   - But it's hard to find!
      - "Whole milk" mozzarella is not the same: it's less moist than fresh 
        mozzarella, but still too moist for pizza.
      - Check the cheese sticks; that's one way you might find it.
      - Also ask the deli counter.
   - If LMWM cheese is not available, part-skim is the next best.
