Ingredients
===========
- 600 g “00” flour
- 390 g water
- 18 g (≈3.5 tsp) salt
- 1.5 g (≈0.4 tsp) active dry yeast

Directions
==========
- Mix all ingredients.

- Knead for 5 min.

- Let rise at room temperature for 24h.

- Divide dough into 4 pieces weighing 250g each [1].

- Form pieces into balls [2].

- Let rise at room temperature for 2-4 h.

- Shape dough by pressing air bubbles out toward the crust [3].

- Bake at 550°F temperature for ~5-7 min [4,5].

Notes
=====
1. The recipe in the notes calls for 300-320 g per pizza, but the video in the 
   references for how to shape the dough calls for 230g.  In this case, the 
   dough weighs about 1kg total, so 250 is about right to get 4 even balls.

4. If possible, bake at higher temperatures for shorter times.

5. Oven protocols:

   - Broil for ~3 min, bake for ~2 min:

     - Cheese nicely browned after 3 min.
     - After ~1 min, I had to keep oven open during broiling, because the 
       flames were running out of oxygen.  The oven temperature dropped very 
       quickly with the door open.
     - Not sure if broiling before or after baking would give a better rise.  
       This did give a good rise, though.
