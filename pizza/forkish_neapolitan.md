Ingredients
===========
- 1000 g (7¾ cups) of 00 or white flour
- 720 mL water
- 1¼ tbsp fine sea salt
- ½ tsp instant dried yeast

Directions
==========
1. Fill a large bowl with 3 cups of warm water

2. Put 2 grams of yeast into a small bowl and add 3 tablespoons of the warm 
   water. Set aside.

3. Combine the flour and the rest of the water into a large bowl. Mix with 
   hands until incorporated. Let rest for 30 minutes, covered.

4. Sprinkle 1¼ tbsp of salt and yeast mixture over the dough. Mix with wet 
   hands to incorporate all the ingredients.

5. Drizzle bottom of bowl and top of dough with olive oil. Cover and let rest 
   for at least 6 hours.

6. Preheat oven to highest temperature up to 600 degrees. Preheat for at least 
   45 minutes with a pizza stone inside the oven.

7. With floured hand, scoop dough onto a large floured surface. Shape into an 
   oval and cut into 5 equal pieces.

8. Shape each piece into a medium-tight ball and place on a floured baking 
   sheet. Top with a sprinkle of flour, cover and let rest for 60 minutes.

9. Refrigerate for 30 minutes before shaping the balls.

10. Shape the balls by punching each side with fingers. Roll fists under the 
    rim of the dough to allow the dough to stretch naturally.

11. Transfer the dough onto a floured pizza peel and top with your favorite 
    sauce and toppings.

12. Gently slide the dough onto the pizza stone and bake for 5 minutes. Then 
    broil for 1-2 minutes.

13. Slice and serve!

Notes
=====
This recipe in many ways is pretty generic: 72% dough, autolyse, long rise (not 
overnight, though), hot oven.

But broiling after baking is an interesting idea.
