Recipe
======
1. Stir together the flour, salt, and yeast in the bowl of an electric mixer.
2. Attach the paddle to the mixer and turn it on at low speed.  Slowly add all
   of the water and oil.
3. Once the ingredients are mixed, switch to the paddle attachment and beat at 
   medium speed for at least 5 minutes.  
4. The dough should now be sticky.  Remove it from the bowl, place it on a 
   floured surface, then cut it into sixths.  Keep each sixth in a plastic bag
   in the refrigerator overnight.
5. On the day you'll make the pizza, take the dough out of the refrigerator 2 
   hours before you want to eat.  On a floured surface, shape the dough into 
   discs that are about 5" wide and ½" thick, then cover with plastic wrap.
6. 1 hour before you want to eat, place a pizza stone in the lowest rack of the 
   oven and preheat the oven to 550°F.
7. Toss the pizza until it's about 12" in diameter, then place on a baking 
   sheet dusted with cornmeal.
8. Add toppings sparingly.
9. Bake for 6-9 minutes.
