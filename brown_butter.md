1. Cook two sticks of butter in a sauce-pot over medium high heat, swirling 
   constantly, until golden brown particles appear and the butter begins to 
   smell nutty.  

2. Remove from heat and continue to swirl for 15 seconds, then add an ice cube 
   and transfer to a chilled mixing bowl and place in the refrigerator.

3. Refrigerate for 20 min, whisking occasionally.
