Recipe
======
1. Melt 3 tbsp butter in a medium saucepan over low heat.

5. Knead on low speed until cohesive dough forms (2-3 min), then knead at 
   medium-low speed for another 1 min.

8. Preheat oven to 425°F.

9. Place croissants in the oven and reduce heat to 400°F.

Notes
=====
- The recipe calls for unsalted butter in the dough, but I only had salted 
  butter.  Lucerne salted sweet cream butter has 90 mg Na⁺ per tbsp.  That 
  corresponds to 686 mg NaCl in the 3 tbsp the recipe calls for.  The nutrition 
  facts for Morton salt say that ¼ tsp weighs 1.5 g, so 686 mg salt is about
  ⅛ tsp.
