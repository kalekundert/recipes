Biga
====
- 71 g all-purpose flour
- 79 mL water (111.3%)
- ¼ tsp yeast

Dough
=====
- all of the biga
- 354 g all-purpose flour
- 296 mL water (88.2%)
- 1 tsp yeast
- 2 tsp salt

Fillings
========
- 1 cup olives (any variety, roughly chopped)  Maybe I should only use 1 tsp 
  salt if I'm using olives...

Toppings
========
- 2 × ⅛ cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 × ½ tsp kosher salt
- 2 × 1 tbsp fresh rosemary (minced)

Recipe
======
- Mix the biga ingredients until just combined.  Cover tightly (to encourage 
  fermentation) and let rise at room temperature for 8-24h.

- Mix the biga with the remaining flour, water, and yeast in the bowl of a 
  stand mixer until just combined.  Cover and let rest for at least 20 min to 
  autolyse.

- Work the salt into the dough, then knead it in a stand mixer with the dough 
  hook for about 13 min, or until it comes together enough to thwap the sides 
  of the bowl for about a minute.  You really have to use a stand mixer for 
  this recipe, because the dough is just too wet to knead by hand.

  If you want any fillings, add them towards the end of the kneading.  Make 
  sure to pat them dry as well as you can, or maybe reduce the amount of water 
  in the dough to account for any water present in the fillings.

- Cover and let rise for 2h, doing drop-hook folds every 30m.

- Shape the dough and transfer it a cast iron pan.

  - Pour half the topping oil and salt into each of two cast iron pans.

  - Scrape the dough onto the counter and divide it half.  Rub a little bit of 
    olive oil around the counter first to prevent the dough from sticking to it 
    (or your hand).

  - Try to shape each half into a ball.  If the dough is too runny to handle, 
    you can do a few stretch-and-folds to firm it up a bit (but it'll still be 
    hard to shape).

  - Roll the balls around the pans to coat them in oil and salt, then let them 
    rest for 20 min.

  If you only have one cast iron pan, put the second half of the dough in the 
  refrigerator.  Take it out when the first half goes in the oven, so it has 
  some time to come back to room temperature before it proofs.

- Press the dough out towards the edges of their pans.  Poke your fingers all 
  the way through the dough while you're doing this.  If the dough starts to 
  resist, let it rest for 20 min then try pressing it out again.

- Proof the dough for about 1h.  While that's happening, preheat the oven to 
  500°F.  When the proof is done, sprinkle the rosemary over the dough, put the 
  two pans in the oven, and turn the temperature down to 450°F.  Bake for about 
  25 min.

    This is pretty much the recipe I have here, but I added a kneading step 
    because I think really high-hydration doughs like these benefit from all 
    the gluten development they can get.

    This recipe encouraged me to increase the length of all the rise steps, and 
    to make sure there is a rise step after every handling of the dough.

    I like that this recipe encourages the use of tons of oil.  It's actually 
    the same amount of oil as this recipe (it calls for ½ cup, but it also has 
    twice as much dough), but I think it's good to keep in mind that you need a 
    lot of oil to get that lightly fried texture.

    This recipe also has advice on how to get the classic "craggly" focaccia 
    look.  Specifically, it recommends actually poking your fingers all the way 
    through the dough while spreading it out.  The holes will fill in during 
    baking and leave nice dimples.  If you just make depressions in the dough 
    without poking all the way through, the bread will come out flat.
