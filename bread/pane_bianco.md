Dianna Wara of Washington, Illinois, took first place in the first-ever National Festival of Breads with this recipe — which we've since simplified a bit, while retaining its award-winning characteristics. Thanks, Dianna!

Dough
=====
- 361 g (3 cups) bread flour
- 2 tsp instant yeast
- 1¼ tsp salt
- 1 large egg
- 113 mL (½ cup) lukewarm milk
- 74 mL (⅓ cup) lukewarm water
- 35g (3 tbsp) olive oil

Filling
=======
- ¾ cup shredded Italian-blend cheese or the cheese of your choice
- ½ cup oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes or your own oven-roasted tomatoes
- 3 to 6 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
- ⅓ cup chopped fresh basil, green or purple

Directions
==========
1. Combine all of the dough ingredients in a bowl (or the bucket of your bread 
   machine), and mix and knead — by hand, using a mixer, or in your bread 
   machine set on the dough cycle — to make a smooth, very soft dough. The 
   dough should stick a bit to the bottom of the bowl if you're using a stand 
   mixer.

2. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover, and let it rise for 45 to 
   60 minutes, or until it's doubled in size.

3. Meanwhile, thoroughly drain the tomatoes, patting them dry. Use kitchen 
   shears to cut them into smaller bits.

4. Gently deflate the dough. Flatten and pat it into a 22" x 8 1/2" rectangle. 
   Spread with the cheese, tomatoes, garlic, and basil.

5. Starting with one long edge, roll the dough into a log the long way. Pinch 
   the edges to seal. Place the log seam-side down on a lightly greased or 
   parchment-lined baking sheet.

6. Using kitchen shears, start 1/2" from one end and cut the log lengthwise 
   down the center about 1" deep, to within 1/2" of the other end.

7. Keeping the cut side up, form an "S" shape. Tuck both ends under the center 
   of the "S" to form a "figure 8;" pinch the ends together to seal.

8. Cover and let rise in a warm place until double, 45 to 60 minutes.

9. While the loaf is rising, preheat the oven to 350°F.

10. Uncover the bread, and bake it for 35 to 40 minutes, tenting it with foil 
    after 20 to 25 minutes to prevent over-browning.

11. Remove the bread from the oven, and transfer it to a rack to cool. Enjoy 
    warm or at room temperature. Store, well-wrapped, at room temperature for a 
    couple of days; freeze for longer storage. 

Notes
=====
- You can substitute all-purpose flour by reducing the water to ¼ cup.
