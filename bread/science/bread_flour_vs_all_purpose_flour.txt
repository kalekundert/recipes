In general, you can substitute bread flour for all-purpose flour and vice 
versa.  The all-purpose flour should allow the load to expand a little more and 
have a slightly more open crumb, but all told the difference will be minor.

That said, bread flour absorbs more water than all-purpose flour does, so you 
might consider adding more or less flour (depending on the substitution you're 
making) in order to get the right dough consistency.
