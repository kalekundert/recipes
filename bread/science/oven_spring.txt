As Emily Beuhler, author of Bread Science explains, oven-spring occurs 
primarily during the first ten minutes of baking. During these ten minutes, the 
yeast—feeling the coming heat—speed up their fermentation and respiration, 
belching out a final burst of CO2. As that CO2 heats up, what was dissolved in 
our dough's water comes out of solution. Like any gas, the CO2 in our dough 
expands as it heats up. This same process occurs to the ethanol created by 
fermentation and a portion of the water mixed into our dough—i.e., they 
evaporate and expand upon heating. Since these gases are trapped inside our 
dough by the gluten matrix we formed during our mixing and fermentation stages, 
as they expand, so does our bread. It's this expansion that causes our dough to 
leap upwards and outwards while in the oven. This is what oven-spring is, and 
we want as much as we can get.
