I want to know more about the role of salt in bread baking.  

It's commonly claimed that yeast is inhibited by salt, but I have a hard time 
believing this.  It's certainly true that high concentrations of salt (or 
sugar) can cause osmotic stress for microorganisms, but the concentration of 
salt in bread is not that high.  If it were, bread would taste salty!  And in 
any case, yeast have cell walls, so they should be more than capable of 
surviving a bit of osmotic pressure.

I saw it suggested once that salt helps stabilize the fold of the gluten 
proteins.  This is much more plausible to me.  I have to admit that I don't 
even understand why salt is important for protein folding, but I am at least 
willing to accept that it is.
