Ingredients
===========
1 loaf:
- 500 g all-purpose flour
- 350 g water (room temperature)
- 1.9 tsp salt (11 g)
- 0.6 tsp instant yeast (2 g)
  - 3/4 tsp active yeast (2.5 g)

2 loaves:
- 1000 g all-purpose flour
- 700 g water (room temperature)
- 3.8 tsp salt (22 g)
- 1.2 tsp instant yeast (4 g)
  - 1.5 tsp active dry yeast (5 g)

These are 1.5 lb loaves.

Brief recipe
============
- 1h autolyse
- 2h bulk ferment (with stretch-and-folds)
- 2h proof
- 30 min bake

Recipe
======
 1. Combine flour and water in the bowl of a stand mixer.  Cover and let 
    autolyse for 1h.

 2. Add the salt and the yeast, then mix until all the ingredients are fully 
    incorporated.

 3. Knead for 3-5 minutes with the dough hook.  By the end, the dough should 
    feel elastic and should bounce partway back when indented with your thumb.

 4. Move the dough to an mixing bowl for the bulk ferment.  Cover the dough and 
    let it rise until it doesn't feel dense, and an impression made with your 
    finger should leave a slight imprint (about 2h).  Stretch-and- fold the 
    dough after 30 min and 60 min.

 5. Move the dough to a floured surface, divide it (if making multiple loaves), 
    and fold it into a bâtard [2].  Then flip it over (so the seam-side is 
    down), dust it with flour, cover it with a towel, and let it rest for 15-30 
    min.

 6. Fold the dough into a bâtard again, then let it rest seam-side down for a 
    few minutes to make sure the seam holds together.

 7. Transfer the bâtards into oiled loaf pans, seam-side down.  Refrigerate 
    until the dough has increased in volume by half and feel well-inflated all 
    the way through (60-90 min).

 8. Preheat the oven to 500°F.  Place racks in the lowest two positions, and 
    put a baking stone on the higher of the two racks.

 9. Just before the loaf finishes its final proof, boil a kettle of water.  Put 
    a baking dish with a nice lip on the bottom oven rack, fill it with boiling 
    water, and wait for the oven to return to temperature.

10. As quickly as possible, remove the baking stone from the oven and put it on 
    the stove.  Flip the loaf onto the stone seam-side down and score the 
    surface with two parallel lines, roughly 3" apart and 1" deep.  Then put 
    the stone back in the oven, above the steaming water, and bake for 15 min.

11. Remove the baking dish with steaming water and reduce the oven temperature 
    to 450°F.  Bake for another 15-20 min, and check the loaf to see if it 
    needs a tent after 10 min.

Notes
=====
- 2021/08/25: The last few times I've tried this, the dough has been really 
  soupy.  I'm suspicious that the Trader Joe's flour is the culprit, although 
  it could also be the humidity.

- 2021/10/10: I made a loaf today with King Arthur flour, and the dough was not 
  soupy.  I think the Trader Joe's flour is the problem; I'm not going to use 
  it again.

- 2021/12/07: I think the key to getting a big rise is to make really deep 
  scores, e.g. 1.5-2 inches.

- 2022/03/27: I made another loaf with KAF flour, and this time it was *very* 
  soupy.  This time I was making a double batch, while the last time I made 
  this recipe (when the dough wasn't soupy) I made a single batch.  I can't 
  remember if I've previously made a double batch and not had the soupiness 
  problem.  I wonder if why scale just isn't accurate for large weights.  Next 
  time, I should try making the double batch by weighing out two individual 
  single batches.

  I added a bunch of extra flour to this batch, and the mass after the bulk 
  rises was 1789 g (compared to an expected 1726).  I wish I'd weighed the 
  flour I added, but it could've been more than 60 g.

- 2022/05/01: I weighed out two single batches today, and when I put them 
  together (in the stand mixer bowl) they weighed the right amount (1700 g).  
  So I don't think there's an issue with the scale.

- 2022/10/02: The dough was soupy after kneading (I've observed the same the 
  last few times I've made this bread).  So twice I added 25 g flour and 
  kneaded for an extra 5 min (50 g and 10 min total).  In the end, the dough 
  held together during the kneading, but still flowed off of the hook after the 
  mixer was turned off.

  - Saw very little rise after 30 min.
  - Did bulk rise for an extra hour.  Some rise, but still not much.  Easily 
    passes finger impression test, though.

- 2024/12/12: This time, I made a double batch with active dry yeast.  I 
  proofed the yeast with 100 mL water, and added that after the autolyse step.  
  The dough seemed pretty soupy after I added that liquid (and the salt) and 
  mixed for ≈10min in the stand mixer.  However, I decided to knead the dough 
  by hand (because the stand mixer wasn't managing to fully incorporate the 
  liquid into the dough), and that seemed to help the dough firm up.  In the 
  future, I might just skip the stand mixer altogether.

  The dough ended up being pretty easy to handle in all of the subsequent 
  steps, and the final loaves were not bad.
