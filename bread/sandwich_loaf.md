Ingredients
===========
Autolyse:
- 1000 g all-purpose flour [5]
- 650 g water (room temperature)

Proof:
- 50 g water (100-110°F)
- 1 tsp (12 g) sugar
- 1.5 tsp (5 g) active dry yeast [3]

Bulk ferment:
- 22 g (3.8 tsp) salt

Brief recipe
============
- 1h autolyse
- 2h bulk ferment (with stretch-and-folds)
- 2h proof
- 30 min bake

Recipe
======
 1. Combine flour and water in the bowl of a stand mixer.  Cover and let 
    autolyse for 1h.

 2. Proof the yeast by combining the water, sugar, and yeast in a small bowl.  
    Let sit for 5-10 min, until the mixture is foamy.

 3. Add the salt and the proofed yeast, then mix until all the ingredients are 
    fully incorporated [4].

 4. Knead for 3-5 minutes with the dough hook.  Then move the dough to a clean 
    surface and knead by hand until it can hold its shape, and feels smooth and 
    elastic.

 5. Move the dough to an mixing bowl for the bulk ferment.  Cover the dough and 
    let it rise until it doesn't feel dense, and an impression made with your 
    finger should leave a slight imprint (about 2h).  Stretch-and- fold the 
    dough after 30 min and 60 min.

 6. Move the dough to a clean surface, divide it in half, and fold both halves 
    into bâtards [2].  Then transfer the bâtards into oiled loaf pans, 
    seam-side down.

 7. Refrigerate until the dough has increased in volume by half and feel 
    well-inflated all the way through (60-90 min).

 8. Preheat the oven to 500°F, with racks in the lowest two positions.

 9. Just before the loaf finishes its final proof, boil a kettle of water.  
    Then fill a baking dish on the bottom rack of the oven with boiling water.

10. Score the loaves straight down the center, about 1.5"-2" deep [6].

11. Put the loaves in the oven, above the steaming water, and bake for 15 min.

12. Remove the baking dish with steaming water and reduce the oven temperature 
    to 450°F.  Bake for another 15-20 min, and check the loaf to see if it 
    needs a tent after 10 min.

[3] You can use a full packet of yeast by making cast iron pizza at the same 
    time as this.

[4] For some reason I always worry that the yeast won't get fully incorporated 
    into the autolysed dough.  I don't need to worry about this.  The dough is 
    pretty wet, and is always very homogeneous at the end of the kneading 
    steps.

[5] I always use King Arthur flour, because at one point I was suspicious that 
    Trader Joe's flour was causing my loaves to turn out badly.  I was never 
    able to confirm this, though.

[6] I think the key to getting a big rise is to make really deep scores, e.g. 
    1.5-2 inches.
