Ingredients
===========
500 g all-purpose flour
350 g water (room temperature)
1.9 tsp salt (11 g)
0.6 tsp instant yeast (2 g)

(I accidentally doubled the yeast and the salt the first time I made this 
recipe.  It was pretty good...)

Recipe
======
1. Combine flour and water in the bowl of a stand mixer.  Cover and let 
   autolyse for 1h.

2. Add the salt and the yeast, then mix until all the ingredients are fully 
   incorporated.

3. Knead for 3-5 minutes with the dough hook.  By the end, the dough should 
   feel elastic and should bounce partway back when indented with your thumb.

4. Move the dough to an oiled mixing bowl for the bulk ferment.  Cover the 
   dough and let it rise until it doesn't feel dense, and an impression made 
   with your finger should leave a slight imprint (about 2h).  Stretch-and- 
   fold the dough after 30 min and 60 min.

5. Move the dough to a floured surface and fold it into a round shape.  Then 
   flip it over (so the seam-side is down), dust it with flour, cover it with a 
   towel, and let it rest for 15-30 min.

6. Fold the dough into a round shape again, then let it rest seam-side down for 
   a few minutes to make sure the seam holds together.

8. Transfer the dough seam-side up to a bowl lined with a lightly floured 
   towel.  Refrigerate until the dough has increased in volume by half and feel 
   well-inflated all the way through (60-90 min).

9. Preheat the oven to 500°F.  Place racks in the lowest two positions, and put 
   a baking stone on the higher of the two racks.

10. Just before the loaf finishes its final proof, boil a kettle of water.

10. As quickly as possible, remove the baking stone from the oven and put it on 
    the stove.  Flip the loaf onto the stone seam-side down and score the 
    surface with two parallel lines, roughly 3" apart and 1" deep.  Put a 
    baking dish with a nice lip on the remaining oven rack, fill it with 
    boiling water, then put the rack with the baking stone and the loaf back in 
    the oven right above it.  Bake for 15 min.

11. Remove the baking dish with steaming water and reduce the oven temperature 
    to 450°F.  Continue baking for 30-35 min.
