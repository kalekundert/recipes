1. Combine ingredients until well-incorporated.

2. Cover and refrigerate for 1-7 days.

3. When you want to make bread, pull off the amount of dough you want to use 
   (e.g. ¼ to ⅓ of the dough, or about 14-19 oz) and shape it.

5. Let the dough rest for 1h, and preheat the oven to 450°F while that's 
   happening.

6. Bake for 25-35 min, until the bread is a deep golden brown.
