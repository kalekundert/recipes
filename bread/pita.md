Ingredients
===========
- 361 g all-purpose flour
- 2 tsp instant yeast
- 2 tsp sugar
- 1½ tsp salt
- 227 mL (1 cup) water
- 25 g (2 tbsp) vegetable oil

Instructions
============
1. Combine all of the ingredients, mixing to form a shaggy/rough dough.

2. Knead the dough, by hand (10 minutes) or by mixer (5 minutes) or by bread 
   machine (set on the dough cycle) until it's smooth.

3. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, and allow it to rest for 1 hour; 
   it'll become quite puffy, though it may not double in bulk. If you've used a 
   bread machine, simply let the machine complete its cycle.

4. Turn the dough onto a lightly oiled work surface and divide it into 8 
   pieces.

5. Roll two to four of the pieces into 6" circles (the number of pieces depends 
   on how many rolled-out pieces at a time can fit on your baking sheet).

6. Place the circles on a lightly greased baking sheet and allow them to rest, 
   uncovered, for 15 minutes, while you preheat your oven to 500°F. (Keep the 
   unrolled pieces of dough covered. Roll out the next batch while the first 
   batch bakes.)

7. Place the baking sheet on the lowest rack in your oven, and bake the pitas 
   for 5 minutes; they should puff up. (If they haven't puffed up, wait a 
   minute or so longer. If they still haven't puffed, your oven isn't hot 
   enough; raise the heat for the next batch.)

8. Transfer the baking sheet to your oven's middle-to-top rack and bake for an 
   additional 2 minutes, or until the pitas have browned.

9. Remove the pitas from the oven, wrap them in a clean dishtowel (this keeps 
   them soft), and repeat with the remaining dough.

10. Store cooled pitas in an airtight container or plastic bag. 

Notes
=====
1. It's hard to describe, but I felt like this tasted like pita-shaped bread 
   more than pita.
