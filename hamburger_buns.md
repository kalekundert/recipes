1. Mix and knead all the dough ingredients.  The dough should be soft and 
   smooth.  Use the smaller amount of water in summer (or in a humid 
   environment), the greater amount in winter (or in a dry climate); and 
   something in between the rest of the time.

2. Cover and let rise until nearly doubled in volume (1-2 hours).

3. Punch down the dough and divide into 8 pieces (≈92 g each).  Shape each 
   piece into a disc about 3" across.  Place the shaped buns onto a greased 
   baking sheet then cover and let rise until noticeably puffy (1 hour).

4. Brush the buns with about half of the topping butter.

5. Bake the buns at 375°F until golden (15-18 min).

6. Remove the buns from the oven, then brush them with the remaining topping 
   butter.  Let them cool on a rack.
