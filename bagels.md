Starter
=======
241 g bread flour
227 mL water (94.2% hydration)
a pinch of instant yeast

Dough
=====
All of the starter
298 g bread flour
1½ tsp instant yeast
2 tsp salt
1 tbsp malted milk powder
113 mL water (63.1% hydration)

Optional ingredients
====================
1 cup fruits or nuts (optional)
4 egg yolks (and only add 57 mL water to the dough because each yolk has about 
14 mL water)

Water Bath
==========
8 cups water
2 tbsp malted milk powder
1 tbsp white sugar

Recipe
======
1. Prepare the starter in a stand mixer bowl, then cover and let grow overnight 
   at room temperature.

2. Combine the dough ingredients in a stand mixer on medium-low speed for 10 
   min.  Expect the dough to be firm enough to hold its shape when the mixer is 
   stopped.  It should also pass the "windowpane" test.

3. Work in any fruits or nuts you want.  Let dried fruits rehydrate in warm 
   water for 5 min so they won't take moisture out of the dough.

4. Let the dough rise in a covered, lightly greased bowl for 60-90 minutes.  
   The dough should be noticeably puffy, but not necessarily doubled in size.

5. Punch the dough down, divide it into 8 ≈110 g pieces, shape each piece into 
   a smooth ball, and place them on a greased baking sheet.

6. Cover the balls and let them rise for 30 min.  Expect them to puff up 
   slightly.

7. Poke a hole in the center of each ball, then briefly twirl it around your 
   finger until the hole is about 1.5" in diameter.

8. Cover the bagels and let them rise for 45 min.

9. Mix the ingredients for the water bath in a large pot and bring it to a 
   boil.  Also preheat the oven to 400°F.

10. Place each bagel, one at a time if necessary, in the boiling water.  They 
    should float to the top after a few seconds.  Boil one side 2 min, then 
    flip over and boil the other side for another 2 min.

11. Bake the bagels for 20-25 min.  Flip them over after 15 minutes to help 
    them stay round.

Questions
=========
- How should I rest and shape the dough after the first rise?  The recipes I've 
  read disagree about how to do this.  The options are:

  - Form balls, rest 30 min, form bagels, rest 45 min, steam (chewy)
  - Form balls, rest 30 min, form bagels, steam (regular)
  - Punch down, rest 10 min, form bagels, rest 10 min, steam (new york)

  I think punching the dough down is a good idea, so much so that I suspect the 
  first two recipes just neglected to mention it, so I included it in my 
  recipe.

  I don't understand why I wouldn't form the bagels immediately after forming 
  the balls.  The dough loses a lot of gas every time I shape it, so it seems 
  like I'd want to do all the shaping at once, then let it rest for a while 
  before steaming and baking.  But of course, none of the recipes I found do 
  that.

  Actually, one good reason for giving the dough some time to rise after 
  shaping the balls is to allow any seams a chance to fill in.

- Should I add malt powder to the dough or the water bath?  Again, the recipes 
  I've read disagree about whether or not to do this.  The options are:

  - Don't use malt powder at all (new york).
  - Optionally add malt powder to the dough (chewy).
  - Add malt powder to the dough and the water bath, and substitute with brown 
    sugar if you don't have malt powder (regular).

  There's technically a difference between malt powder and malted milk powder.
  Malt powder is just malt powder, and can (I'm told) be more easily found as 
  barley malt syrup in grocery stores.  Malted milk powder is malt powder 
  combined with dehydrated whole milk powder.  I've been using malted milk 
  powder, but you might get better results with malt powder.

  For what it's worth, malt powder is considered a "cheating" way to get the 
  flavor of the Maillard reactions, since it contains large amounts of free 
  amino acids.  The "not cheating" way to get this flavor is to autolyse the 
  dough, which gives the proteases in the flour time to create free amino acids 
  on their own.

  A number of recipes online claim that malt powder can be substituted with 
  brown sugar.  From a chemistry perspective, brown sugar would promote the 
  caramelization reactions instead of Maillard reactions, although the products 
  from both reactions can taste similar.  Chemistry aside, both sugar and free 
  amino acids could also speed up fermentation by providing a more easily 
  digestible food source for the yeast.  I was curious about how sugar might 
  affect fermentation, and for once I was able to find a good answer quickly:

    Sugar affects the rate of fermentation reactions.  A little sugar, up to 
    three percent, speeds up fermentation.  The yeast processes the added sugar 
    first, saving the time it would take to break down starch into sugar.  With 
    over three percent sugar, however, the fermentation rate no longer 
    increases [1].  Above six percent, sugar actually decreases the rate.  This 
    is because the sugar begins to dehydrate the yeast cells.  This effect is 
    called "crenation".

    on dough and bread properties." Cereal Chemistry 28 (1951) 463-473.
    (Unfortunately I can only find the abstract for this reference, and it's 
    not clear if the percents it refers to are relative to flour or water...)

- I couldn't fit two baking sheets in the oven side-by-side, so next time I'll 
  have to give it some thought if I want to bake more than 6 bagels at once.

  Update: I tried using two racks, but the bagels on the lower rack cooked much 
  faster than those on the upper one.  This surprised me a bit, I thought the 
  bagels on the upper rack might cook faster because warmer air rises, but 
  apparently radiation from the coil is the more significant source of heat.  
  Perhaps next time I'll try switching the racks every 5 min.
